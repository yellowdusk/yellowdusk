			<p><strong>A:</strong> Enough. I will have done with improving myself: with guilt, with shame, with this perpetual sense of insufficiency. It wastes me. Enough.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> So you are happy with who you are?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Happy? I <em>am</em> who I am, that sufficies. What need do I have for happiness atop the fact?</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> But surely you are better now than you once were. [<em>B draws A&rsquo;s mind to recollection of his awkward and intolerable younger self.</em>] And why should that improvement cease now?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I am different now than I was. Why say &ldquo;better&rdquo;? But suppose I am &ldquo;better&rdquo;, as you suggest—and you <em>are</em> me, so your suggestion carries weight; this I cannot deny—<em>so?</em> I became who I now am only by once being who I once was. I do not claim a vast and comprehensive mind, but I do not see any other route to my present state. Strewing my past selves before me as the bus rolls onward and over them—would this not be ungrateful?</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> Then will you cease changing? Rest content, forever, where you are?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Doubtful. Change will have its way. I see no need to hasten it, true, but neither do I see grounds for resistance. To have done with improvement is not to have done with change.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> How will you control the direction of this change, without some ideal in mind?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> You overrate ideals, my friend. My present state answers to none of my former ideals. Either, then, they are of rather poor aim, or—what I think more likely—they are simply impotent. As I said, change will have its way.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> I shall leave you, then. You have no more need of me.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I will not stop you, if that is what you think best, but I have one request: do not pretent I forced you out. My friends are always welcome here.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> I am your friend, then?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Oh yes, beyong question! Who ever doubted it?</p>
