		<h1>Blizzard (Henri Cole)</h1>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Henri Cole—who in my limited but non-trivial prior encounters proved himself to be one our better contemporary poets—has written a bad book. <em>Blizzard</em>, his latest, elicits frequent groans and offers, in return, only intermittent pleasures.</p>
<p>It is difficult to forgive a poet the use of the wrong word. When Cole writes, in &ldquo;Black Mushrooms&rdquo;, that &ldquo;Even the luxury-loving / Romans savored their palatal starlight&rdquo;, that &ldquo;palatal&rdquo; rings false. It is the adjectival form of &ldquo;palate&rdquo; (in the roof of the mouth), and the best sense I can give it here is that the sky, which houses the stars, is a kind of roof. Generously, it is a metaphor to no purpose; more accurately, it is simply wrong.</p>
<p>Less wrong, but no less frustrating, is the reference, in &ldquo;To a Snail&rdquo;, of the animal&rsquo;s &ldquo;gelid body&rdquo;. It is not <em>wrong</em>, as &lsquo;gelid&rsquo; can mean merely &ldquo;cold, chill, cool&rdquo;, but it is a word better suited to its sense of &ldquo;extremely cold, cold as ice, frosty&rdquo; (both from the OED)—its use mean merely &ldquo;cool&rdquo; does not justify its strangeness.</p>
<p>Beyond such picky (which does not mean: unimportant) matters, the poems in this problem too frequently strive for a revelation they do not find. At the end of &ldquo;Lingonberry Jam&rdquo;, Cole&rsquo;s narrator feels &ldquo;autonomous, blissed-out, and real.&rdquo; In the already-encountered &ldquo;To a Snail&rdquo;, we learn that &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long game—the whole undignified, insane attempt at living&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;The Party Tent&rdquo; assures us that, &ldquo;Like musical notes or forms / of rock, everything will be forgotten.&rdquo; I am twelve pages in with these examples; the whole volume thumps the reader over the head with these epiphanies, largely cliché and rarely earned by the preceding text.</p>
<p>Cole&rsquo;s best work (<a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/07/02/henri-coles-self-portrait-with-rifle/">e.g.</a>) avoids what is easy. <em>Blizzard</em> seeks it. Its first poem ends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With your fuzzy black face, do you see me— <br>
a cisgender male—metabolizing <br>
life into language, like nectar sipped <br>
up and regurgitated into gold?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That &ldquo;a cisgender male&rdquo; arrives, so far as I can tell, from nowhere. Nothing in the rest of the poem indicates that it is a reflection on gender, nor is it retroactively deepened by being read as such. I can discern no poetic purpose in this self-identification, except a kind of crass writing for, rather than against, the times. (Lest I be misread: transphobic poetry would be be &ldquo;against&rdquo; the times, it would simply be transphobic.) But if the phrase is a mere signal, it is not an effective one: the acknowledgments show two of the poems in this volume appeared in <em>The New Criterion</em>, whose pages routinely contain virulent hatred directed against trans people.</p>
<p>The volume&rsquo;s title poem ends with one of the familiar epiphanies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need everything within <br>
to be livelier. Infatuation, sadism, lust: I remember them,</p>
<p>but a memory of feeling is not feeling, <br>
a parasite is not the meat it lived on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What <em>Blizzard</em> lacks is just this infatuation, sadism, and lust—the feelings themselves, and not their pale memories. One can only hope that these lines at least indicate Cole&rsquo;s awareness of the problem. That would be the first step to a superior sequel.</p>
