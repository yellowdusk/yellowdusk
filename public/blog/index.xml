      <description>It is puzzling why Parmenides, staid prophet of the inalterable One, should open his great poem with the depiction of a journey, of much-prompted mares that carry him to the limits of his heart&amp;rsquo;s desire, straining at the carriage, guided by a coterie of maidens. Yet how else except by such an image was he to capture the delirious freedom of the fetters in which Justice has bound the Whole? How other than through the &amp;ldquo;stationary movement&amp;rdquo; (Valery) of metaphor was he to give voice to his unshaken ecstasy?</description>

      <description>It is firmly established that the stories of the Zhuangzi accreted over an extended period and are not the work of a single hand. Even the traditional view that Zhuang Zhou himself wrote only the inner chapters (1-7) is suspect. Hell, not even the mere historical existence of Master Zhuang is above doubt. Nevertheless.
Nevertheless, there is a thematic unity to the inner chapters that dissipates (but does not vanish) in the outer and miscellaneous chapters.</description>

      <description>Over the past two years, I have been slowly and haphazardly developing a meditation practice, predominantly in the Zen tradition. The details of what I do have changed over time; currently I am working on a form of koan training. Rough details are:
 I use the bamboo method of breathing, where each exhalation is broken up by brief pauses (rather than releasing my breath continuously) I breathe in a cycle of one long exhalation (seven bamboo segments) followed by four short exhalations (two bamboo segments) With each bamboo segment, I focus on one syllable of the koan  The koan I am using, adapted from a translation by Katuski Sekida, records a conversation between the monk Seizei and the Zen master Sōzan:</description>

      <description>1. Insignificance Near the start of Nature, Ralph Waldo Emerson distinguishes two senses of his key term: nature as all that is not myself (including my body), and nature as all that is not artifice. But, he says, no confusion will arise from this, for all the effects of human artifice&amp;hellip;
 &amp;hellip;taken together are so insignificant, a little chipping, baking, patching, and washing, that in an impression so grand as that of the world on the human mind, they do not vary the result.</description>

      <description>[1] &amp;ldquo;THE NAME AND THE SOUL&amp;rdquo;
“The soul,” Susan Howe tells us, “appears or occurs as something we feel compelled to live into or move toward as if it were there floating a little apart and at an angle or” (20). The ending of that quote is no error: the other possibilities go unsaid. The soul, on this model, is not a possession. Ever out of reach, it draws us onward.</description>
