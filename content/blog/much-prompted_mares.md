It is puzzling why Parmenides, staid prophet of the inalterable one, should open his great poem with the depiction of a journey, of much-prompted mares that carry him to the limits of his heart's desire, straining at the carriage, guided by a coterie of maidens. Yet how else except by such an image was he to capture the delirious freedom of the fetters in which Justice has bound the Whole? How other than through the "stationary movement" (Valery) of metaphor was he to give voice to his unshaken ecstasy? Forgive him, then, this innocent falsehood, this white lie.
